# Finales Funkeln

A simple ray tracer based on Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing in One Weekend][1]
and [Ray Tracing: The Next Week][2].
Written in Rust during [hackaTUM 2018][3] by Boris-Chengbiao Zhou, Daniel
Lenhardt, and Moritz Singhartinger. The final state of Finales Funkeln after
hackaTUM 2018 can be found in the `hackatum2018` branch. `master` contains
additional features added after the event.
