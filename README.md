# Finales Funkeln

![rendered image](assets/demo.jpg "rendered image")

A simple ray tracer based on Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing in One Weekend][1].
Written in Rust during [hackaTUM 2018][2] by Boris-Chengbiao Zhou, Daniel
Lenhardt, and Moritz Singhartinger. The final state of Finales Funkeln after
hackaTUM 2018 can be found in the `hackatum2018` branch. `master` contains
additional features added after the event.

## Future Work
- Document parts of the code
- Implement features from the sequel book: [Ray Tracing: the Next Week][3]
- Spectral rendering
- Profile & Optimize
- Scene description format
- [IES][4] [lights][5]
